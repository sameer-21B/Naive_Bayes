-----------NAIVE BAYES ALGORITHM FOR NLP BINARY CLASSIFICATION ------------------------------
For training the model:
1.Preprocess your dataset(apply stopwords removal,removing punctuation marks,stemming,lematization etc.).
2.Create a vocaubulary of words out of your training dataset.
3.create a table which contains a count of classwise occurence of each word present in your dictionary.
4.perform Laplacian Smoothing and calculate the Log likelihoods of each word in your vocabulary.
For making predictions:
1.preprocess the tweet of which sentiment is to be predicted.
2.calculate the log probabilities and sum it up.if the overall value is greater than zero than the tweet is positive else it is negative.
